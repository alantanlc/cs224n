# Doing your research example:

Straightforward Class Project: Apply NNets to Task

## 1. Define Task:
- Example: Summarization

## 2. Define Dataset
1. Search for academic datasets
  - They already have baselines
  - e.g. Newsroom Summarization Dataset: [https://summari.es](https://summari.es]  
2. Define your own data (harder, need new baselines)
  - Allows connection to your research
  - A fresh problem provides fresh opportunities!
  - Be creative: Twitter, Blogs, News, etc. There are lots of neat websites which provide creative opportunities for new tasks

## 3. Dataset hygiene
  - Right at the beginning, separate off devtest and test splits
  
## 4. Define your metric(s)
  - Search online for well established metrics on this task
  - Summarization: Rouge (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) which defines _n_-gram overlap to human summaries
  - Human evaluation is still much better for summarization; you may be able to do a small scale human eval

## 5. Establish a baseline
  - Implement the simplest model first (often logistic regression on unigrams and bigrams or averaging word vectors)
    - For summarization: See LEAD-3 baseline
  - Compute metrics on train AND dev
  - Analyze errors
  - If metrics are amazing and no errors:
    - Done! Problem was too easy. Need to restart. :) / :(
    
## 6. Implement existing neural net model
  - Compute metric on train and dev
  - Analyze output and errors
  - Minimum bar for this class

## 7. Always be close your data! (Except for the final test set!)
  - Visualize the dataset
  - Collect summary statistics
  - Look at errors
  - Analyze how different hyperparameters affect performance

## 8. Try out different models and model variants. Aim to iterate quickly via having a good experimental setup.
  - Fixed window neural model
  - Recurrent neural network
  - Recursive neural network
  - Convolutional neural network
  - Attention-based model
  - ...
